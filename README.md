This is a basic guessing game created using JavaScript.  It prompts the user to guess what the weather will be like tomorrow.  The program randomly selects a weather condition from an array of possibilities, and matches the user input with this selection.

The program then alerts the user with a message based on whether or not the user input matched the computer's random selection.  A clipart image of the user's guess and the computer's answer will also be displayed, as well text stating what the user and computer guessed.

The default weather conditions that the computer knows are: rainy, sunny, snow, hail, cloudy, and foggy.

If the user guesses something that is not in the array, it shows a default picture and notifies the user that the game doesn't have a picture of it.
