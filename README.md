This is a basic guessing game created using JavaScript.  It prompts the user to guess what the weather will be like tomorrow.  The program randomly selects a weather condition from an array of possibilities, and matches the user input with this selection.  The program then alerts the user with a message based on whether or not the user input matched the computer's random selection.
