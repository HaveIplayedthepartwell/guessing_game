This is a basic guessing game created using JavaScript.  It prompts the user to guess what the weather will be like tomorrow.  The program randomly selects a weather condition from an array of possibilities, and matches the user input with this selection.  The program then alerts the user with a message based on whether or not the user input matched the computer's random selection.  A clipart image of the user's guess and the computer's answer will also be displayed.

The default weather conditions that the copmuter knows are: rainy, sunny, snow, hail, cloudy, and foggy.
